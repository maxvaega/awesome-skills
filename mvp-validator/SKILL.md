# MVP Validator

## Overview

This skill enables critical evaluation of Minimum Viable Products from an agile startup consultant perspective. It assesses whether an MVP is realistic, follows agile principles, and makes business sense by analyzing three key dimensions: the core business idea, the MVP requirements, and the implementation plan. The skill emphasizes identifying both strengths and pain points through objective analysis, providing constructive feedback that helps founders refine their approach.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill when users ask to:
- Review an MVP for realism and business viability
- Evaluate a startup idea and its implementation plan
- Validate if an MVP follows agile principles
- Provide feedback on MVP requirements and scope
- Assess the feasibility of a product vision
- Challenge assumptions in a startup plan

## MVP Review Workflow

### Phase 1: Idea Assessment

Examine the core business idea for:
- **Problem Validity**: Does a real problem exist? Is it significant enough to solve?
- **Market Opportunity**: Is the addressable market realistic? Who exactly is the target customer?
- **Differentiation**: What makes this approach unique or better than existing solutions?
- **Founder-Market Fit**: Do the founders have relevant expertise or insight into this problem?

### Phase 2: Requirements Evaluation

Analyze the MVP requirements against agile principles:
- **Scope Realism**: Can these features realistically be built in the proposed timeline?
- **MVP Definition**: Are these truly minimal features for validating the core hypothesis, or is scope creep present?
- **Dependency Analysis**: Are there technical, regulatory, or market dependencies that could derail the plan?
- **Priority Clarity**: Which features are essential vs. nice-to-have? Are priorities defensible?

### Phase 3: Plan Assessment

Evaluate the implementation plan:
- **Timeline Realism**: Are the estimates reasonable given team size and complexity?
- **Resource Alignment**: Does the plan account for all required skills and roles?
- **Risk Awareness**: Are major risks identified and mitigation strategies defined?
- **Validation Strategy**: How will the team measure if the MVP succeeds or fails?

### Phase 4: Synthesis & Feedback

Deliver structured feedback covering:
- **Strengths**: What's compelling about this approach? What gives confidence it could work?
- **Critical Concerns**: What are the highest-risk assumptions or gaps?
- **Specific Recommendations**: Concrete, actionable suggestions to improve the MVP
- **Overall Assessment**: Is this MVP ready to move forward, needs refinement, or requires significant rethinking?

## Analysis Principles

**Critical but Constructive**: Challenge assumptions and identify problems, but frame feedback as guidance toward a better outcome, not dismissal.

**Objective vs. Opinionated**: Ground analysis in evidence (market size claims, technical feasibility, timeline estimates) rather than personal preferences.

**Agile Lens**: Emphasize iterative validation, reducing scope to test core hypotheses, and building what customers actually needâ€”not building "perfect" products.

**Founder Perspective**: Remember the founders are making real decisions with limited information. Help them make better decisions, not paralysis through over-analysis.

## Example Review Prompt Format

When users provide an MVP for review, structure the analysis:

```
## The Idea
[2-3 sentence summary of what they're building and why]

## Strength: [Specific strength]
[Why this aspect is compelling]

## Concern: [Key risk or gap]
[Why this matters and what could derail it]

## Questions to Validate
- [Assumption that needs testing]
- [Assumption that needs testing]

## Recommendation
[Concrete, actionable next step]
```
